# Mars Rover Simulation 🚀

## Overview

Welcome to the Mars Rover Simulation project! This Java-based application simulates a Mars Rover navigating a grid-based terrain. The Rover can move forward, turn left, and turn right, while avoiding obstacles and staying within the boundaries of the grid. The project emphasizes pure Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), design patterns, and robust software design principles.

## Features

- *Grid-Based Navigation*: The Rover navigates a grid defined by user inputs.
- *Mode Selection*: The Rover can be moved interactively or by giving a set of commands at the beginning.
- *Rover Commands*: Supports commands to move forward, turn left, and turn right.
- *Obstacle Detection*: The Rover detects obstacles and records their positions.
- *Status Report*: The Rover provides status reports on its current position and direction.
- *Design Patterns*: Utilizes Command Pattern, Composite Pattern, and other OOP principles for a clean and maintainable codebase.

## Key Components

### Grid

Represents the terrain the Rover navigates. Handles grid boundaries and obstacles.

### Rover

The main entity that moves on the grid. Encapsulates its position, direction, and movement logic.

### Commands

Encapsulates movement commands (Move, TurnLeft, TurnRight) using the Command Pattern for flexibility and extensibility.

### Obstacles

Represents obstacles on the grid. The Rover records any encountered obstacles during navigation.

## Design Patterns

- *Command Pattern*: Encapsulates 'M', 'L', 'R' commands as objects.
- *Composite Pattern*: Represents the grid and obstacles.
- *Singleton Pattern*: Manages the state of the grid.
- *OOP Principles*: Applies encapsulation, polymorphism, and inheritance effectively.


Follow the prompts to input grid size, obstacles, starting position, direction, and commands.

### Example

1. **Enter Grid Dimensions:**
   - `Enter grid width: 10`  
   - `Enter grid height: 10`

2. **Set Obstacles:**
   - `Enter number of obstacles: 2`
   - `Enter obstacle 1 x-coordinate: 2`
   - `Enter obstacle 1 y-coordinate: 2`
   - `Enter obstacle 2 x-coordinate: 3`
   - `Enter obstacle 2 y-coordinate: 5`

3. **Set Starting Position and Direction:**
   - `Enter starting x-coordinate: 0`
   - `Enter starting y-coordinate: 0`
   - `Enter starting direction (N/E/S/W): N`

4. **Choose Mode:**
   - `Enter 1 for Normal mode or 2 for Interactive mode: 1`

5. **Enter Commands:**
   - `Enter the number of commands: 6` (Optional, Based on the mode selected) 
   - `Enter commands (M for move, L for turn left, R for turn right):`

6. **Example Commands:**
   - `M` (Move forward)
   - `M` (Move forward)
   - `R` (Turn right)
   - `M` (Move forward)
   - `L` (Turn left)
   - `M` (Move forward)


-Output:

-Rover is at (1, 3) facing North.
Rover encountered obstacles at:
(2, 2)


## Code Structure

  - *commands*: Command Invoker, Command implementations (MoveCommand, TurnLeftCommand, TurnRightCommand)
  - *grid*: Grid, Grid Component and Obstacle classes
  - *rover*: Rover, Direction, and StatusReport, classes
  - *Main.java*: Entry point of the application
