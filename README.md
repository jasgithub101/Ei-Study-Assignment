# Overview

This is a submission for the Educational Initiatives Campus Recruitment Drive. 
It involves 2 Coding Exercises completed as per the specifications and constraints detailed in the document provoided.

# Exercise 1: Problem Statement on Design patterns

1. Two use cases to demonstrate two behavioural design pattern---Observer & Interpreter
2. Two use cases to demonstrate two creational design pattern---Factory method & Singleton
3. Two use cases to demonstrate two structural design pattern---Adapter & Composite

For info about the Implementation, Refer README.md within the corresponding directories.

# Exercise 2: Problem Statements for Mini-projects

## Problem Statement 3: Mars Rover Programming Exercise:

Create a simulation for a Mars Rover that can navigate a grid-based terrain. Your Rover should be able to move forward, turn left, and turn 
right. You'll need to make sure that it avoids obstacles and stays within the boundaries of the grid. Remember to use pure Object-Oriented 
Programming, design patterns, and avoid using if-else conditional constructs

For info about the Implementation, Refer README.md within Mars Rover directory.
